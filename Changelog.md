## v0.6.0 (Release)
This release aims to improve the compatibility of the new in-game menu (especially when used with frame-gen) and add support for DLSS 3.7.

### Added
* Added spoofing support for DLSS 3.7, usage description is below
* Added spoofing support when running as `dxgi.dll` (acts like [d3d12-proxy](https://github.com/cdozdil/d3d12-proxy)).
* Added support for loading custom `nvapi64.dll` file when not working as `nvngx.dll` (from dll folder or user defined folder).

### Fixed
* Tried to cover all frame-gen cases for the new in-game menu, hopefully it will be ok (There is a detection delay of about 170 frames, if the menu does not appear immediately after loading the game, please wait a bit after pressing the menu button)
* Fixed setting wrong internal rendering resolution during create feature (thanks to **Sub** & **DARKERthanDA**)
* Fixed when DLSS selected from ini was not applied when using DirectX 11 (thanks to **...Merlinch** & **wixuan**)
* Fixed `Motion Sharpness` issues (thanks to **Od1sseas**)
* Increased the `Motion Sharpness` scale minimum to 0.1 to prevent division by zero problems (thanks to **fakemichau**).
* Added extra checks for `Output Scaling` and `Display Size MV` (Thanks to **DARKERthanDA**)
* Fixed reverting to initial upscaler on quality or resolution change when working with DLSS Enabler (thanks to **fakemichau**).
* Auto disable `RCAS` and `Output Scaling` on shader compilation issues, for linux check notes are at bottom (thanks to **fakemichau**).
* Fixed `Output Scaling` disabling conditions (Thanks to **DARKERthanDA**)
* Fixed conflicting preset selection & quality ratio when using DLSS (thanks to **...Merlinch?**)
* Added `yield()` to /w Dx12 backend query wait spins, resulting in improved performance on Nvidia cards (thanks to **DARKERthanDA**)

### Changed
* The structure of `nvngx.ini` has changed a bit, if your old settings are not applied, please compare with the new structure.


## v0.5.5 (Release)
**Added**
* Added DLSS upscaling support, when using DLSS with OptiScaler you will have DLSS specific;
  - Control over DLSS presets (DLSS 3.x only)
  - Auto enabling DLSS support for 16XX GPUs
  - Added spoofing for GetFeatureRequirements
  - Override DLSS sharpening (up to DLSS 2.5.1)
* Also with DLSS you can use OptiScaler's;
  - Scaling overrides
  - Override DLSS init flags
  - In-game menu
  - RCAS sharpening (only on Dx12)
  - Output resolution scaling (only on Dx12)
* Added **new in-game menu** which works on all APIs and does not affected by games rendering pipeline. In case of compatibility issues (or for nostalgia üòÖ ) old menu still can be enabled by setting `OverlayMenu=false` from `nvngx.ini` (Thanks to **TheRazerMD**, **regar** **DARKERthanDA**, **Brutale1090**, **iamnotstanley** and **Od1sseas** for all the testing). 
* Added `Motion Sharpening` option, which increases sharpening amount of pixels based on their motion. (RCAS only) (Thanks to **Od1sseas**)
* Added option to select RCAS for FSR upscalers (Dx12 and Dx11 with Dx12 only)
* Added an option to round internal resolution to desired number
* Added DRS (Dynamic Resolution Scaling) now have options to limit minimum or maximum resolution to render resolution. 
* Added more integration options with [DLSS Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/757)

**Changed**
* XeSS upscaling library `libxess.dll` is not statically linked anymore. This means now even without `libxess.dll` mod works (ofc without XeSS support). With new ini option users can point a folder which contains library or even if game natively supports XeSS mod now uses library loaded by game. Also with limited testing I can confirm 2 different versions of XeSS libraries (for example game loads 1.2.0 and mod loads 1.3.0) coexist and work on same instance.
* CAS sharpening replaced with RCAS, which solves issues with bloom, glow and other effects etc.
* Super Sampling option evoled into Output Scaling, now it's working based on display resolution and in 0.5 - 3.0 scaling range. This allows users to set lower target resolutions than display resolutions which was requested by Deck users. 
* Restructured in-game menu to show only currently available options to prevent confusion.
* DRS range limited to 0.5x - 1.0x to mimic Nvidia aproach

**Fixed**
* Sometimes DLSS upscaler had wrong motion vectors setup, now fixed (Thanks to **DARKERthanDA**)
* Some games were not releasing the mouse, now they should be fixed. (Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc.) 
* Some games were not registering mouse clicks, now they should be fixed. (Doom Eternal) (Thanks to **TheRazerMD**)
* Dx11 XeSS libxess.dll not found fallback fixed
* Added controls for junk Vulkan DLSS init data and prevent crashes
* Added SDK version checks for logging options


## v0.4.3 (Release)
New:
* Added an in-game menu scaling option

Changed
* Added new options for Dx11wDx12 creation & syncing. I have tried to explain it [here](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/blob/master/Config.md#dx11withdx12-sync-settings). These settings are game & hw dependant so users need to tweak and find best performing configuration for their system. I have set safe and balanced values as default values.


## v0.4.2 (Release)
New:
* XeSS now have a new parameter `CreateHeaps` (default **true**). When it's enabled OptiScaler internally create heap objects and bind them instead of relying XeSS to create them. This fixes Guardians of the Galaxy black screen with XeSS issue. (Thanks to **TheRazerMD**)

# OptiScaler 

## v0.4.1 (Release)
Mod renamed to **OptiScaler**

Fixed:
* Crysis 3 Remastered showing black screen w/Dx12 backends on non-Arc GPUs fixed. (Thanks to **closesim** & **TheRazerMD**)

Changed:
* Dx11wDx12 backends had a few seconds worth of delays to ensure stability and compatibility. After the improvements made in v0.4 release looks like these delays aren't necessary anymore. For compatiblity sake I have added a new parameter `UseDelayedInit` (default **false**) for enabling these delays again.

## v0.4.0 (Release)
New:
* Added XeSS 1.3 support and matched DLSS quality modes with XeSS quality (with v1.3 libxess.dll mod uses UltraPerformance & NativeAA modes of XeSS)
* Added ImGui in-game menu with saving ini ability for Dx11 and Dx12 backends (shortcut key is **HOME**)
* Added Pseudo-SuperSampling option for DirectX 12 upscalers
* Added option to change MipmapLodBias
* Added option to restore Compute and Graphic root signatures after upscaling
* Added [this](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2/pull/27) patch to FSR 2.1.2 (DLSS depth buffer is always in 0.0-1.0 range it might help on dilated depth)
* Added auto enabling logic for AutoExposure
* Added auto disabling logic for DisplaySizeMotionVectos
* Added option to limit Maximum Dynamic Resolution (DRS)
* Added support for NVNGX logging API (for better integration with [DLSS Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/757))
* Added documentation for [settings](https://github.com/optiscaler/OmniScaler/blob/master/Config.md) and [issues](https://github.com/optiscaler/OmniScaler/blob/master/Config.md) 

Fixes:
* CAS is now disabled by default for compatiblity reasons, can be enabled from in-game menu or from ini
* CAS errors will not cause black screen or screen not updating but CAS will be auto disabled
* Fixed `UpscaleRatioOverride`, it works correctly now
* Fixed `QualityRatioOverride` min witdh limiting for DRS
* Fixed blackscreen issue with Dx11wDx12 upscalers (Thanks to **Sildur** and **KITE**)
* Added simple logic to check if upscaler is running to enable menu shortcut key (Thanks to **krispy**)
* Fixed Crysis 3 black screen issue
* Fixed default ini & log saving location, now it's next to `nvngx.dll` file
* *More and more* Dx11 with Dx12 stability and performance improvements (Still not enough for Arc tho üò¢ )
* ~~Fixed washed out colors with XeSS in Alan Wake 2 & Stranger of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origin (ColorSpaceFix option in ini)~~ Thanks to [Intel](https://github.com/intel/xess/issues/19) not needed anymore

## v0.3.3 (Release)
New:
* Added FSR2 (2.1.2) support for DX11 (w/DX12), DX12 and Vulkan
* Added FSR2 (2.2.1) support for DX11 (native & w/DX12 options), DX12 and Vulkan
* Improved performance of w/DX12 **a lot**, should be around **%85-90** of native performance now (if experiencing crashes, there is a new ini option for compatibility)
* Added black screen fix for native FSR2 DX11 games (God of War, Nioh II, etc.)
* Added auto-fixes for Unreal Engine 4/5 games (Xmas lights, weird colors etc.)
* Added CAS support back for XeSS (default enabled)
* Added DLSS Enabler upscaler selection integration
* Added Vertical Fov calculation from horizonal fov for FSR (not tested)
* And much more minor fixes that I can't remember now

Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with FSR backends, init parameter MaxRenderResolution is now DisplayResolution (Fixed black screen problem with Ratchet & Clank - Rift Apart, Spiderman)


## v0.2.0 (Release)
* Thanks to **Artur** much better implementation of NVNGX API now CyberXeSS is usable with his excellent [DLSS Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/757)
* Now DLSS Sharpness value is used for CAS (can be forced from ini)
* Now DisableReactiveMask is default true for better compatibility (can be changed from ini)
* Fix for HDR DLSS flag (was inverted in some occasions)
* Removed DelayedInit option which was breaking DLSS 
* Added ResourceBarrier support for all input sources (can be set from ini)
* Added optional quality ratio overrides for fixing flickering in some Unreal Engine game (can be enabled from ini)
* Added libxess.dll to package for easy installation

  
## v0.1.0 (Release)
* Added CAS support (Check ini file for options)
* Added alpha Dx11 support (with possible performance & compatibility problems)
* Added fix (ini option ColorResourceBarrier=true) for rainbow colored texture problems on AMD hardware (thanks to Nukem & LukeFZ)
* Added logging console option (Any logging level below 2 may cause performance issues)
* General stability improvements
